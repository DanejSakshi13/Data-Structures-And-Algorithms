#### Assignment 1 : 
Implement the Heap/Shell sort algorithm implemented in Java demonstrating heap/shell data structure with modularity of programming language.

#### Assignment 4 : 
Beginning with an empty binary search tree, Construct binary search tree by inserting the values in the order given. After constructing  binary tree 
i. Insert new node
ii. Find number of nodes in longest path
iii. Minimum data value found in the tree
vi. Search a value

#### Assignment 5 :
Construct an expression tree from the given prefix expression eg:+-a*bc/def and traverse it using post order traversal (non recursive) and then delete the entire tree.

#### Assignment 7 :
Represent a given graph using adjacency matrix/list to perform DFS and using adjacency list to perform BFS. Use the map of the area around the college as the graph. Identify the prominent landmarks as nodes and perform DFS and BFS on that.

#### Assignment 11 :
Department maintains student information. <the file contains roll number, name division and address. Allow users to add, delete information about students. Display information of a particular student. If the record of the student does not exist an appropriate message is displayed. If it is , then the system displays the student detials. Use a sequantial file to maintain the data.
