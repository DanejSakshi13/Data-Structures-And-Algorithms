#### Assignment 1 : 
Implement the Heap/Shell sort algorithm implemented in Java demonstrating heap/shell data structure with modularity of programming language.

#### Assignment 2 :
Consider telephone book database of N clients. Make use of a hash table implementation to quickly look up clientâ€˜s telephone number. Make use of two collision handling techniques and compare them using number of comparisons required to find a set of telephone numbers.

#### Assignment 3 : 
Implement all the functions of a dictionary (ADT) using hashing. Data: Set of (key, value) pairs, Keys are mapped to values, Keys must be comparable, Keys must be unique Standard Operations: Insert(key, value), Find(key), Delete(key)

#### Assignment 4 : 
Beginning with an empty binary search tree, Construct binary search tree by inserting the values in the order given. After constructing  binary tree 
i. Insert new node
ii. Find number of nodes in longest path
iii. Minimum data value found in the tree
vi. Search a value

#### Assignment 5 :
Construct an expression tree from the given prefix expression eg:+-a*bc/def and traverse it using post order traversal (non recursive) and then delete the entire tree.

#### Assignment 6 :
A dictionary stores keywords and its meanings. Provide facility for adding new keywords, deleting keywords, updatng values of any entry. Provide a facility to display whole data sorted in ascending /descending order. Also find how many maximum comparisions may require for finding any keyword. Use binary search tree for the implementation.

#### Assignment 7 :
Represent a given graph using adjacency matrix/list to perform DFS and using adjacency list to perform BFS. Use the map of the area around the college as the graph. Identify the prominent landmarks as nodes and perform DFS and BFS on that.

#### Assignment 8 :
There are flight paths between cities. If there is a flight betwee ncity A and city B then there is an edge between the cities. The cost of the edge can be the time that flight takes to reach city B from A, or the amount of fuel used for the journey. Represent this as a grap. The node can be represented by the city name. Use representation of graph. Check whether the graph is connected or not. Justify the storage representation used.

#### Assignment 9 :
A dictionary stores keywords and its meaning. Provide facility for adding new keywords, deleting keywords , updating values of any entry. Provide a facility to display whole data sorted in asceding/descending order. Also find how many maximum comparisions may require for finding any keyword. Use height balanced tree and find the complexity for finding a keyword.

#### Assignment 10 :
Read the marks obtained by students for second year in an online examination of a particular subject. Find out maximum and minimum marks obtained in that subject. Use heap data structure. Analyze the algorithm.

#### Assignment 11 :
Department maintains student information. <the file contains roll number, name division and address. Allow users to add, delete information about students. Display information of a particular student. If the record of the student does not exist an appropriate message is displayed. If it is , then the system displays the student detials. Use a sequantial file to maintain the data.
